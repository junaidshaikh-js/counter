### What I learned

I had practised event delegation in this project. In event delegation if you have multiple elements having similar kind of event on them, you group them together in one element and listen to that event on the parent element. It thus reduce the effort of listening event on every single element. Also I divided the program over multiple functions keeping in mind that one funtion should only do one task correctly.
